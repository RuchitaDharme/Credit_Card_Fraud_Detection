# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Logistic Regression is a regression approach used for predicting only two possible values.

For this project, we will be building a machine learning model to classify whether a credit card transaction is Normal or Fraudulent based on numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation included in the dataset. Our goal is to work through this notebook by collecting data, preprocessing it, splitting it into testing and training datasets, train the model and evaluate the accuracy of our model.
